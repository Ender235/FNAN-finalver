This is a FNAF parody game created by Ricardo Rubert and Sam Sivorn that wanted to make something so that their online friends could enjoy, in total it has 6 nights and 4 diffrent animatronics.

To run the game you will need the Pygame library

Graphics were mainly done by Ricardo and Coding by Sam however, they did swap roles a couple times through development.

Graphics were done by taking a export of a roblox model of the avatars, and putting it in blender, positioning it as well as the light and then rendering it. Then combining the images with the render to try and get a realistic effect.

Coding was done by painstakingly creating every button and every frame into an image then each frame the game state is checked and rendered acordingly to what the game state tells it to render.
